# Importing Users

>__INFO__
>This how-to document explains to administrators how to import users so they can build and manage the >system’s user base.

## Prerequisites
You need administration permissions to log in to the admin panel.

## Steps
1. In the Administration Panel’s left navigation pane, click __Settings__.    
2. Select __Import Users__.
_The system displays the Import functionality screen._
3.  Specify the user’s email address. Optionally, you can also enter the user’s name and phone.   
4.  If the user shall receive the email notification prompting to set up a password, mark the __Send activation email__ checkbox.
5.  To import the user, click Import.
 
> __IMPORTANT!__
When you trigger the import, the system creates the user account and assigns it to the organization. Users log in using their corporate authentication data for Single Sign On integration.
>
>The System builds a unique user identifier for each imported user. Users can display their identifiers as QR >codes and use them to open their lockers. Alternatively, users can open their lockers in the Collectomate >Progressive Web Application.

## Next Steps
In the Administration Panel’s left navigation pane, go to the __Users__ section and ensure that the imported users exist.
